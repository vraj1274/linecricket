  return <CoachProfilePage onBack={() => setCurrentPage('home')} />;
```

### **Profile Switching Logic**

  switch (profileType) {
    case 'academy':
      return 'academy-profile';
    case 'venue':
      return 'venue-profile';
    case 'coach':
      return 'coach-profile';
    case 'player':
    default:
      return 'profile';
  }
};
```

### **Automatic Navigation**
```tsx
onClick={() => {
  switchProfile(profile.id);
  const profilePage = getProfilePage(profile.type);
  onPageChange(profilePage as any);
  setShowProfileSwitch(false);
}}
```
